# jupyter_notebook_format
Formatting tips and tricks for your Jupyter notebook.

## About this project
This project is a collection of Markdown and formatting used in Jupyter notebooks. 
My favorite code editing tool is VS Code. With VS Code, you use packages and extensions to build your code. 
In VS Code, there is a nice python linter and a wicked cool formatter called Black. 

You install Black by running the command: (pending you have anaconda installed) <br/>
`conda install -c conda-forge black`

Formatters aside, when you create your Jupyter notebook, be sure to give your code some love. Apply some markdown!! 
Is it missing something? Feel free to add!
