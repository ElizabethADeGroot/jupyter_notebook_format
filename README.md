# jupyter_notebook_format

Formatting tips and tricks for your Jupyter notebook.

## About this project

This project is a collection of Markdown and formatting used in Jupyter notebooks.
My favorite code editing tool is VS Code. With VS Code, you use packages and extensions to build your code.

## Project Setup

1. Download/Clone the project
2. Open a new terminal and run the following command: \

>> `jupyter notebook`
A new browswer window will open. Dbl click inot Formatting.ipynb file to open up the formatting notebook. Run each cell to see the formatting.

### Additional Tools

In VS Code, there is a nice python linter and a wicked cool formatter called Black.\
You install Black by running the command: (pending you have anaconda installed) \
`conda install -c conda-forge black`

Formatters aside, when you create your Jupyter notebook, be sure to give your code some love. Apply some markdown.
