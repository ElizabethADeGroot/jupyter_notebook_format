# jupyter_notebook_format

Formatting tips and tricks for your Jupyter notebook. This project is not meant to be a tomb of Markdown or Jupyter tricks. Instead, this project is a starting point for how you could format your Jupyter projects. Consistency is key.

## About this project

This project is a collection of Markdown and formatting used in Jupyter notebooks.
My favorite code editing tool is VS Code. With VS Code, you use packages and extensions to build your code.
